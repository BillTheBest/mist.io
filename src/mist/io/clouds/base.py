class BaseController(object):
    """Abstract base class for every cloud/provider controller

    This base controller factors out all the steps common to all or most
    clouds into a base class, and defines an interface for provider or
    technology specific cloud controllers.

    Subclasses are meant to extend or override methods of this base class to
    account for differencies between different cloud types.

    Care should be taken when considering to add new methods to a subclass.
    All controllers should have the same interface, to the degree this is
    feasible. That is to say, don't add a new method to a subclass unless
    there is a very good reason to do so.

    The following convention is followed:

    Any methods and attributes that don't start with an underscore are the
    controller's public API.

    In the `BaseController`, these public methods will in most cases contain
    a basic implementation that works for most clouds, along with the proper
    logging and error handling. In almost all cases, subclasses SHOULD NOT
    override or extend the public methods of `BaseController`. To account for
    cloud/subclass specific behaviour, one is expected to override the
    internal/private methods of `BaseController`.

    Any methods and attributes that start with an underscore are the
    controller's internal/private API.

    To account for cloud/subclass specific behaviour, the public methods of
    `BaseController` call a number of private methods. These methods will
    always start with an underscore, such as `self._connect`. When an internal
    method is only ever used in the process of one public method, it is
    prefixed as such to make identification and purpose more obvious. For
    example, method `self._list_machines__postparse_machine` is called in the
    process of `self.list_machines` to postparse a machine and inject or
    modify its attributes.

    This `BaseController` defines a strict interface to controlling clouds.
    For each different cloud type, a subclass needs to be defined. The subclass
    must at least define a proper `self._connect` method. For simple clouds,
    this may be enough. To provide cloud specific processing, hook the code on
    the appropriate private method. Each method defined here documents its
    intended purpose and use.
